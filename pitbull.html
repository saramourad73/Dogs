		                        American Pit Bull are not a good choice for people who can give them little or no attention.
								They must be trained and socialized when young to overcome the breed's tendencies toward
								stubbornness and bossiness,  if he hasn't learned you are in 
								charge ;Your American Pit Bull Terrier must be kept on leash in public to prevent
								aggression toward other dogs.<br /><span class="fo">&diams; </span> It's not a good idea to let these dogs run loose in dog parks. While they might 
								not start a fight, they'll never back down 
								from one, and they fight to the finish. American Pit Bulls who aren't  socialized as puppies can become aggressive toward other
								dogs.Breed-specific legislation almost always includes this breed. Be aware of rules in your area as well as
								neighboring regions if you travel with your dog.<br><span class="fo">&diams; </span>   American Pit Bull Terriers have a great need to chew, and powerful jaws make quick
								work of cheap or flimsy toys. Give yours only tough, durable toys that can't be chewed up and swallowed.<br> American Pit Bull Terriers are best suited to owners who can 
								offer firm, fair training, and gentle consistent discipline.

					 <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">P</span>it bulls were created by crossbreeding bulldogs and terriers 
                                        to produce a dog that combined the strength of the bulldog with the gameness and agility of the terrier.In the United Kingdom, these dogs were used in blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting.
										These blood sports were officially eliminated in 1835, as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws.<br/> 
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">S</span>ince dogfights were cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull- or bear-baits,
										blood sport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead.<br/>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">D</span>og fighting was used as both a blood sport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting took place clandestinely in small areas of Britain and America.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 20th century, pit bulls 
										were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions.
										Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.</p>

               <p class="ull">No one dog’s markings are the same,
			   so many Pit Bulls can have different markings and color patterns,
			   despite being in the same litter. Bluenose and Rednose,
			   for instance, aren’t separate breeds, 
			   but rather different Pit Bull colors of the same dog.
			   Bluenose will typically have a gray/blue nose as well as gray/blue fur with white markings, 
			   but even here, their colors can vary. A blue litter may have dark or light eyes, 
			   and they can also come in brindle or fawn colors. 
			   Brindle blue Pit Bulls usually have a tan or brown variation with dark contrast.
			   Bluenoses will even have gray/blue tones to their eyes and toenails.<br/>

Rednoses usually come in red, fawn, brown, and brindle colors.
Their noses are not dark or light, but reddish-brown, as the name suggests. 
Some more trending Pit Bull colors are the white accent-markings on their head, chest, feet, and tail.
 Red patterns vary in solid, spotted, and brindle, as well as with white or black masks.
 In order to achieve these desired Pit Bull colors, rednoses are generally bred with rednoses,
 just like bluenoses are bred with bluenoses. That said, they are also quite rare,
 which means they tend to fetch a higher price than other color variations. <br></p>
