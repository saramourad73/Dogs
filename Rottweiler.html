				<p class="fon"><span class="fo">&diams; </span>Rottweilers have been known from the times of Ancient Rome. Actually, they are descendants of Roman drover dogs which traveled with the legions during the European conquests.

                    In ancient times, there was no refrigeration and logistics were quite different from today, so a large army needed a reliable and versatile dog to herd livestock, pull carts with food, and guard the soldiers.

                    Many breeds have one or two aforementioned abilities at most, but Rotties can do it all. They owe this to their high intelligence and rugged build. Whether it is under the Mediterranean sun or the winter time in the Alps, 
                    <span class="fo">&diams; </span>Rotties do their duty without complaining. As the legion spread the Roman empire, so did the Rotties spread across Europe, becoming sheepdogs, guards, and working companions.
                    Rotties were especially popular in Germany, hence the name. Rottweil was an important center of trade during the Roman times, but even when the Romans were pushed out of the region by the Germanic tribes, the dog stayed.The breed got the name “Rottweiler Metzgerhund” meaning “The butcher’s dog from Rottweil” because these pooches used to herd livestock, pull carts with meat.<br><span class="fo">&diams; </span> There are sources which claim that
                     butchers used to keep their money in a pouch hung around the Rotties’s neck. Now, who would dare to steal from them?

                    What’s interesting about the breed is that their looks haven’t changed much over the centuries. Even when the demand for them declined in the late 19th century, a few which remained were used to revive the breed for the purpose 
                    of serving in the First World War. Rotties got new duties as messengers and ambulance dogs.

                    Today, Rotties are as popular as always, still serving as family dogs, guards, and working canines.

					 <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">T</span>he Roman Empire was the organizing force behind Western Europe’s formative years, and dog breeding was among the many pursuits forever altered by the Roman genius for practical problem solving.

                        When conquering Roman legions marched to far-flung corners of the world, they brought their herds with them as food on the hoof. The army required tough, durable dogs to move and guard the herd. Utilizing Asian mastiff types as breeding stock,
                         the Romans developed the distant ancestor of today’s Rottweiler. For centuries the legions struggled to contain Germanic tribes, the so-called barbarian hoards, massed on the Empire’s northern borders.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">T</span>he dogs the Romans brought to these areas became
                         foundation stock for many German breeds.

                        In the centuries after the empire’s collapse, the Roman drover dogs found work in the cattle town of Rottweil. It was here, moving herds from pasture to market and protecting all concerned from bandits and rustlers along the way, that they earned the name
                         Rottweiler Metzgerhund, or Butcher’s Dog of Rottweil.

                        The Rottie’s career in livestock ended with the rise of the railroad cattle cars in the 1800s. They found new work as police dogs, personal protectors, and all-around blue-collar dogs capable of performing various heavy-duty tasks. Rotties were among the first
                         guide dogs for the blind, and in more recent times they distinguished themselves as search-and-rescue workers at such disaster sites as Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center.

                      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">C</span> onsidering the many roles the breed has played during its long history, it is remarkable that the Butcher’s Dog has changed little in form and temper since its first German breed standard was drawn up in 1901.</p>

               <p class="ull"> A Rottweiler is always, by any breed club standards,
			   black with well-defined mahogany or rust-colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog's body color.
			   All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, 
			   one strip on each side of the snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black.
			   The markings on the face should move down onto the dog's throat. On the chest,
			   a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes.
			   On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle,
			   then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. 
			   There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well.
			   A thin strip of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler's toes <br></p>
