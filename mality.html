					<p class="fo">(General information)</p>
				<p class="fon"><span class="fo">&diams; </span>The Maltese is a toy dog breed that has a compact and square body. 
				It is entirely covered with silky, long, flat and white hair that, if allowed to grow to full length, hangs nearly to the ground.
				Its expression is both alert and gentle. As a vigorous dog, the Maltese moves with a smooth, lively, and flowing gait;
				it may even appear as the dog is actually floating on the ground when it is trotting. 
								<br><br>
								<span class="fo">&diams; </span>Even though the small dog is known for its unusual coat, other features like the facial expression,
								the body structure, and overall carriage are equally important. The Maltese is a delicate dog with round, black eyes and ears that are dropped.
								Its tail, meanwhile, is long and carried over the back.
								The Maltese coat is usually seen in pure white, though there is sometimes a light tan or lemon hue on the ears. 
								
								<br><br><br><span class="fo">&diams; </span>If the Maltese is allowed to become the pack leader,
								it may develop behavior disorders and become anxious and stressful. This may also lead to unnecessary barking and snapping at strangers,
								other dogs and children. Additionally, it is not recommended a good pet for families with younger children. So love a Maltese all you want,
								just make sure to establish a firm and clear chain of command  
								<br><span class="fo">&diams; </span>The exercise needs of the Maltese may be met with a romp in the courtyard, a short leash-led walk, or vigorous indoor games.
								Its coat, which may be clipped for easier maintenance, requires combing on alternate days and needs special grooming attention.
								The Maltese is generally considered an unsuitable outdoor dog but can fare well in either the city or the country.  <br>
								<span class="fo">&diams; </span>The Maltese, which has a lifespan of 12 to 14 years, may suffer from deafness, shaker syndrome, and dental problems.
								It is also prone to minor health issues like patellar l, hydrocephalus, open fontanel, hypoglycemia,
								distichiasis, and portacaval shunt... <span class="fo">&diams; </span> To identify some of these issues, a veterinarian may run knee,
								eye, and thyroid exams on this breed of dog.<br>The Maltese is spirited, lively and playful. Gentle, loving, trusting and devoted to its master.
								Highly intelligent. Good at learning tricks. Bold and quick to sound the alarm in case of suspicious noises.
								It is a classic companion dog: graceful and lovable. It does well with other non-canine animals and other dogs. Maltese love to play outdoors. <br>
								 <span class="fo">&diams; </span> Do not over-pamper or overprotect these little dogs, for they will become unstable, and some may become jealous of visitors.
								 Maltese that are allowed to take over the house, being boss of the humans, can also develop separation anxiety, guarding and obsessive barking.
								 These are not Maltese traits, but rather behaviors brought on by the way the dog is treated by the people around it.
								 These behaviors will go away when the dog is surrounded by stable pack leaders.

                  <center></center>

					 <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">F</span> or more than 28 centuries, the Maltese spaniel has been the aristocrat of the dog world.
					 It is believed that the Maltese originated in Malta, a tiny island south of Sicily. It is only fitting that such a noble dog be established in Malta,
					 whose civilization was distinguished by its sophistication and opulence.
										 <br/>
										 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">O</span>ne Maltese of note, Issa, was owned by Publius,
										 the Roman governor of Malta in the 1st century. Issa was described in a celebrated epigram as "frolicsome … purer than a dove's kiss,
										 gentler than a maiden … more precious than Indian gems." Many famous authors and scholars, including Pliny the Elder and Strabo,
										 wrote of the beauty, finesse and irresistible charm of the tiny Maltese dog.   
								          <br/>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">T</span>he Greeks erected tombs to their Maltese and, from the 5th century on,
										these ornate dogs are represented in Greek ceramic art. Archaeological evidence exists to show that Maltese dogs were owned by the Egyptians who may have worshiped them. 
								           <br/> 
										
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">I</span>he Maltese has been highly valued in society throughout time. In fact,
										one account is of a Maltese being sold in the 1500s for the equivalent of $2,000.
										It is said that Maltese dogs were particularly popular with women who carried them in their bosoms or their sleeves.
										Invariably, scholars of yore drew attention to the breed's diminutive size.
										 <br/>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="u">I</span>n 1792, the botanist Linnaeus referred to Maltese as being "about the size of squirrels.
										" The first Maltese exhibited in the United States was white and listed as a "Maltese lion dog" at Westminster's first dog show in 1877.
                         The American Kennel Club registered the Maltese in 1888.<br/> </p>

               <br> Maltese have more guard dog tendencies, although both breeds will yap excessively if not trained appropriately <br>The breed was likely introduced to the Phoenicians,
			   a Mediterranean maritime trading society between 1550 BCE and 300 BCE. This is before the rise of ancient Greece.This breed was likely introduced to Malta,
			   where the breed takes its name from by nomadic tribes and is thought to be descended from a spitz-type dog bred by Swiss Lake Dwellers to catch rodents.<br> 
                      Some people suggest that there is also some evidence that it may also be related to the Tibetan terrier from Asia.

        The first record was found on a Greek container (amphora) found in the Etruscan town of Vulci in modern day Italy dated to 500 BC.

        This breed has been enjoyed by the wealthy ladies all over the world and is even pictured on golden age ceramics although called the ‘Melitaie Dog’ at the time of the Greeks. </p></td>

				No humble beginnings for this breed. The name itself of Shih Tzu translates to ‘lion dog’ and can be dated as far back as to 800 BC.
				It is thought that the breed we know and love today was developed within the secretive walls of the Chinese emperor’s palace by imperial breeders crossing two Sino-Tibetan breeds, the Pekingese and the Lhasa Apso,
				two ancient breeds.The latter of which was perhaps gifted by the Dalai Lama to the Chinese emperors in the 17th century.

                These breed remained the royal dog for hundreds of years and the emperors would even give gifts to those breeders who could produce the most beautiful and affectionate dogs.

                It wasn’t until the 1930’s that the breed became known outside the palace by breed clubs from Peking and later England and now owners have included Queen Elizabeth II and Miley Cyrus.

                     This is again a popular breed ranking 12th on the list for the mirrors publicly voted favorite dog breeds and ranked 20th in 2017 for the American Kennel club.</p></td>

               <p class="ull">  Have you ever wondered if there is a black Maltese or maybe a brown Maltese?
			   The answer is that unless you have painted the dog black or brown or red or blue then there is no chance that the puppy being sold is a purebred Maltese.
			   Maltese dogs which are purebred are only permitted to have white, white with tan, white with lemon,
			   white with cream and white with pale orange depending on the dog show criteria and which association the dog show rules are being run under.
			   These variations in color are the only accepted colors of a purebred Maltese in dog shows.
			   That doesn’t mean that these isn’t a Maltese cross breed with black in its coat.
			   This article will address the common questions around the colors of a Maltese dog and remove all the rumors around the rare colors for a Maltese puppy. <br></p>
